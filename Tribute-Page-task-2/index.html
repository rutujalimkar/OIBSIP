      <h2>The Magnificent Story of Mary Kom</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Mary Kom is the most celebrated boxer in India. Her journey is an inspiration to thousands of Indians,
        especially many Indian women.She was born to a northeastern family and helped her parents in the fields.</p>

      <p>As a child, she was interested in sports, but didn’t pay much attention to boxing. It was Dingko Singh and her
        gold medal at the Asian Games that inspired Mary Kom to take up a career in professional boxing.As a young girl
        from an economically backward Manipuri household, Mary Kom didn’t receive support from her family and society.
        She kept her interest a secret, as the patriarchal society discouraged any notions of a woman becoming a boxer.
        She faced many struggles and was discriminated throughout her journey. However, she continued to focus on her
        dreams despite all odds.</p>

      <p>Today, she stands as the only Indian woman boxer to win a medal in the Olympics. She also became the first
        Indian woman boxer to get a Gold Medal in the Asian Games in 2014 in South Korea.In a country where women are
        still working towards achieving independence and basic rights, Mary Kom made us understand what a woman can
        truly accomplish. She pursued her dreams and laid a foundation for many people to take up different routes to
        achieve their success. She proved that hard work and determination pays well. Her victory and success are a
        result of her continual efforts and aspirations.</p>

      <p>Mary Kom is among the few successful people who pushed all boundaries and made it big.In spite of her success
        and popularity, Mary Kom’s journey continues to be challenging. She faces discrimination and regional bias even
        now at different events, including the Commonwealth Games trials, where she was treated unfairly. But this
        doesn’t stop her from fighting. She puts such experiences behind her and proves her worth in the ring.Mary Kom’s
        accomplishments and contributions to the country in the field of sports have been recognized by the government.
        She received the Padma Shri in 2010 and the Padma Bhushan in 2013 for her achievements.She has started the Mary
        Kom Regional Boxing Academy with the help of the government. In an interview, she said that she wishes to
        produce thousand Mary Koms. Her life experiences have been documented in her autobiography Unbreakable and also
        in the movie Mary Kom, in which she was played by actor Priyanka Chopra.</p>
